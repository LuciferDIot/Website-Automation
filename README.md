<h1>Automation Script using Selenium (Java) and TestNG</h1> 
This repository contains an automation script written in Selenium (Java) and TestNG for a specific scenario. The script utilizes different locator strategies such as id, name, and XPath to enhance the robustness and reliability of the tests.

<h2>Scenario Description</h2> 
The script automates a test scenario that involves logging into a website using pre-created account credentials. Before executing the script, it is necessary to enter a test email address and create an account on the website. The script will then use the provided credentials to perform the login process.

<h2>Test Plan</h2>
The test plan for this scenario should include the following steps:

<ul>
    <li>Precondition: Enter a test email address and create an account on the website.</li>
    <li>Launch the web browser and navigate to the login page.</li>
    <li>Enter the previously created account credentials (email and password) into the appropriate input fields.</li>
    <li>Click on the "Login" button.</li>
    <li>Verify that the login was successful by checking for the presence of expected elements on the subsequent page.</li>
    <li>Perform any additional test steps or verifications as required.</li>
    <li>Close the browser and end the test.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Execution</h2>
To execute the automation script, follow these steps:

<ol>
    <li>Set up the Selenium WebDriver and TestNG in your Java development environment.</li>
    <li>Clone this repository or download the script files.</li>
    <li>Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.</li>
    <li>Update the script with the necessary test email address and pre-created account credentials.</li>
    <li>Run the script to execute the automated test scenario.</li>
    <li>Please ensure that you have the appropriate dependencies and configurations set up for Selenium, TestNG, and any other required libraries.</li>
</ol>

Note: It is important to use different locator strategies (id, name, XPath) throughout the script to avoid any deduction of marks.

Feel free to customize and extend the script based on your specific requirements and testing needs.

Happy testing!
